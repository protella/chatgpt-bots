## [2.0.0] - 2024-09-12

### üéâ Major Release - Complete V2 Rewrite

This release represents a complete rewrite of the ChatGPT Bots project, focusing on production stability, user experience, and advanced AI capabilities.

### ‚ú® New Features

#### Core Architecture
- **Responses API Migration**: Migrated from OpenAI's Chat Completions API to the new Responses API for advanced tool calling. The Chat Completions API is now deprecated.
- **Stateless Design**: Platform (Slack) as source of truth with dynamic context rebuilding
- **Abstract Base Client**: Modular architecture supporting multiple platforms
- **SQLite Persistence**: User preferences, thread settings, and message caching
- **Thread Management**: Concurrent request handling with proper locking mechanisms

#### User Experience
- **Interactive Settings Modal**: Configure preferences via `/chatgpt-settings` command
- **Thread-Specific Settings**: Different configurations per conversation
- **Custom Instructions**: Personalized AI behavior per user
- **Multi-User Context**: Proper handling of shared conversations with username tracking
- **Welcome Flow**: First-time user onboarding with guided setup

#### AI Capabilities
- **Intelligent Intent Classification**: Automatic detection of image/text/vision/edit requests
- **Image Generation & Editing**: Natural language image creation and modification
- **Vision Analysis**: Process uploaded images with detailed descriptions
- **Document Processing**: Extract and analyze PDFs, Office files, code files
- **Web Search Integration**: Current information retrieval (GPT-5 models)
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time message updates with circuit breaker protection

#### Models & Configuration
- **Multi-Model Support**: GPT-5, GPT-5 Mini, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o
- **Dynamic Parameters**: Model-specific settings (reasoning_effort, verbosity for GPT-5)
- **Token Management**: Smart trimming with configurable thresholds
- **Utility Models**: Separate models for different tasks (analysis, utilities)

### üîß Technical Improvements

#### Performance
- Thread-safe operations with comprehensive locking
- SQLite WAL mode for concurrent database access
- Automatic message trimming at 80% token capacity
- Circuit breaker pattern for streaming failures

#### Testing
- 100+ unit tests with 80%+ coverage
- Integration tests for OpenAI API interactions
- Load testing verified with production workloads
- Comprehensive test fixtures and mocks

#### Developer Experience
- Makefile for common operations
- Structured logging with rotation
- Environment-based configuration
- Comprehensive error handling
- Type hints throughout codebase

### üìù Configuration Changes

#### New Environment Variables
- `SETTINGS_SLASH_COMMAND`: Customizable settings command
- `DEFAULT_REASONING_EFFORT`: GPT-5 reasoning depth
- `DEFAULT_VERBOSITY`: Response detail level
- `UTILITY_REASONING_EFFORT`: For quick operations
- `ANALYSIS_REASONING_EFFORT`: For complex tasks
- `TOKEN_BUFFER_PERCENTAGE`: Dynamic token limits
- `ENABLE_WEB_SEARCH`: Web search capability
- `ENABLE_STREAMING`: Real-time responses
- Multiple streaming configuration options

#### New Slack Scopes
- `groups:history`: Private channel access
- `users:read`: Workspace member information
- `users:read.email`: Email address access

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- Fixed race conditions in concurrent message processing
- Resolved settings persistence issues under load
- Fixed scope selection logic for new vs existing users
- Addressed oversized Slack message handling
- Fixed thread context mixing in shared conversations

### üìö Documentation
- Comprehensive README with setup instructions
- Detailed CLAUDE.md for AI assistant guidance
- SQLite integration plan
- User settings modal design document
- Responses API implementation details
- Test documentation and templates

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
- Discord support temporarily removed (V2 rewrite in progress)
- Changed from Chat Completions to Responses API
- New database schema
- Updated environment variable structure
- Modified logging configuration

### üîÑ Migration Guide

1. **Database Migration**: No migration path from V1 - fresh install
2. **Environment Variables**: Update `.env` using `.env.example` as template
3. **Slack App**: Add new required scopes in Slack App settings
4. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate GPT model and defaults in configuration
5. **Custom Instructions**: Users should configure via `/chatgpt-settings`


### üôè Acknowledgments
Special thanks to all testers who participated in load testing and helped identify edge cases.
