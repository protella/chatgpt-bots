## [2.0.4] - 2025-09-16

### üêõ Critical Bug Fix - Bot Hanging Resolution

#### Fixed
- **Removed problematic `timeout_wrapper` that was causing zombie threads and bot hanging**
  - The wrapper was creating daemon threads that continued running after timeouts
  - These threads held HTTP connections, eventually exhausting the connection pool
  - Bot would become unresponsive after multiple timeouts, requiring manual restart
- Now using OpenAI SDK's native timeout handling via httpx
- Bot no longer hangs after consecutive timeout errors

#### Changed
- Improved timeout error messages to clearly indicate OpenAI as the source
  - "OpenAI Timeout" instead of generic "Taking Too Long"
  - "OpenAI's API is not responding" with specific timeout duration
  - All user-facing messages now explicitly mention OpenAI service issues
- Updated tests to remove references to deleted `timeout_wrapper`

#### Added
- Integration tests for intent classification model comparison
- Better timeout tracking and logging for diagnostics

## [2.0.3] - 2024-12-15

### üîß Code Quality & Reliability Improvements

#### Changed
- Refactored codebase to improve maintainability and reliability
- Cleaned up unused imports across all modules
- Fixed unused variables (`channel`, `truncated`, `content_preview`, `removed_msg`, etc.)
- Replaced bare except clauses with specific `Exception` handling
- Cleaned up f-string placeholders without variables
- Improved custom instructions handling in main prompt

#### Added
- Comprehensive timeout error handling test suite (`test_timeout_error_handling.py`)
- 586 new test cases covering various error scenarios
- Better error context and recovery strategies

#### Fixed
- All linting issues identified by ruff and pyright diagnostics
- Improved exception propagation throughout the codebase

## [2.0.2] - 2024-12-14
