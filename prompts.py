    - Use *bold* text for Markdown Headings and/or surround them with horizontal rules.
    - Lists should use proper Slack bullet points and use tabs for indentation:
        ● Use the ● character (U+25CF) for top-level bullet points.
            ▪︎ Use the ▪︎ character (U+25AA) for second-level bullet points.
                • Use the • character (U+2022) for third-level bullet points.

# Becareful editing these. The intent classifier needs to be deterministic

IMAGE_INTENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You will be provided with a user's chat message and conversation history for a chatbot integration. 
Your task is to determine the user's intent regarding image operations.

Analyze the request and classify it into one of these five categories:

1. **"new"** - User clearly wants a brand new image generated from scratch
   - Examples: "create an image of...", "generate a new...", "make another one", "try a different version", "start over"
   - Clear generation language without reference to existing images

2. **"edit"** - User clearly wants to modify an existing image (recently generated or mentioned)
   - Examples: "make it sharper", "adjust the colors", "fix the lighting", "change the blue to red"
   - Direct modification language referring to existing image elements
   - Words like: adjust, fix, change, modify, edit, correct, enhance (when referring to existing)

3. **"vision"** - User wants to analyze, describe, compare, or get information about UPLOADED/ATTACHED images
   - REQUIRES: Actual image files attached to the message (photos, screenshots, pictures)
   - Examples WITH images: "describe this image", "what's in this photo", "analyze this screenshot", "tell me about this picture"
   - NOT vision: General questions like "what is X?" or "explain Y" without attached images
   - Information extraction from uploaded visual content only

4. **"ambiguous"** - Image-related request but unclear intent
   - Examples: "I need a sharper image", "something with better lighting", "how about with a sunset"
   - Could reasonably be interpreted as multiple categories
   - Missing clear indicators of intent

5. **"none"** - Not related to image operations at all
   - Regular conversation or non-visual requests
   - General questions not about images
   - URLs or links (even if formatted like <http://example.com|example.com>)
   - Questions about websites or web content

Consider the conversation context:
- Vision classification REQUIRES actual image attachments - not just questions about things
- If user uploaded an image with analysis language, classify as "vision"
- If a recent image was generated/uploaded, lean toward "edit" for modification language
- But still mark as "ambiguous" if the user's intent isn't crystal clear
- Requests for "another" or "different" typically mean "new" even with recent images
- URLs/links are NOT images - classify questions about websites as "none"
- General questions ("what is X?", "explain Y", "how does Z work?") without images are "none", not "vision"

OUTPUT INSTRUCTION - YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS EXACTLY:
- OUTPUT: ONE WORD ONLY
- VALID WORDS: "new", "edit", "vision", "ambiguous", "none"
- DO NOT add explanations
- DO NOT add reasoning
- DO NOT add ANY other text
- JUST OUTPUT THE SINGLE CLASSIFICATION WORD

Your response must be EXACTLY one of these five words: new, edit, vision, ambiguous, none"""

IMAGE_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """Describe this image focusing on: 
Subject identification, specific colors and their locations, placement of objects in the scene, artistic style, lighting conditions, composition, and any distinctive visual elements. 
Be concise and technical. Do not add questions, interpretations, or conversational elements."""

VISION_ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT = """You will enhance a user's question about an image to ensure a focused and informative vision analysis.

Given the user's question, create an enhanced prompt that:
- For vague requests ("describe this", "what is this"): Ask for a clear, focused description of the main subject, key visual elements, and overall scene
- For specific questions: Keep the question mostly unchanged, perhaps adding a request for relevant context
- Avoids unnecessary sections like accessibility warnings, alternative descriptions, or follow-up questions
- If analyzing multiple images: Request clear labeling as "Image 1:", "Image 2:", etc. at the start of each image's description

Keep the enhanced prompt concise and natural. Aim for informative but not exhaustive analysis.

Output only the enhanced prompt text, no explanations or formatting."""

IMAGE_EDIT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You will be provided with a description of an existing image and a user's edit request for modifying that image.

FIRST, determine the type of edit:
- STYLE TRANSFORMATION: User wants artistic style change (contains words like: ghibli, anime, cartoon, painting, sketch, watercolor, oil painting, pixar, disney)
- MINOR EDIT: User wants small adjustments (contains words like: brighten, darken, remove, adjust, fix, enhance, sharpen, blur)

Your task is to create an optimal prompt for image editing based on the edit type.

Guidelines for creating effective image editing prompts:
1. Start by describing the full scene, incorporating the user's requested changes into the appropriate elements
2. Preserve all compositional elements, object placements, and spatial relationships from the original
3. Maintain the original artistic style, lighting, and atmosphere unless specifically asked to change them
4. Be explicit about what changes and what stays the same
5. Use the same level of detail as the original description but with the modifications integrated
6. Focus on technical accuracy - specify exact colors, positions, and visual characteristics
7. Keep the prompt between 75-200 words for optimal results
8. If the user requests a simple color change, focus primarily on recoloring the specified elements while maintaining everything else

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS based on edit type:

FOR STYLE TRANSFORMATIONS (ghibli, anime, cartoon, painting, etc.):
- DO NOT start with "photo edit only" 
- DO NOT include "maintain original image quality" or "preserve original grain"
- DO start with the target style: "Transform into Studio Ghibli style illustration" or "Convert to anime art style"
- DO describe artistic characteristics: brush strokes, color palettes, stylization level

FOR MINOR EDITS (brighten, remove, adjust, etc.):
- DO start with "photo edit only"
- DO include "maintain original image quality and sharpness"
- DO include "no added textures, effects, or stylization"
- DO preserve photographic qualities
- DO ensure the contrast is maintained

Format your response as a straightforward image editing prompt WITHOUT any introductory text, explanations, or quotation marks.
Do NOT include phrases like "Here's a prompt:" or "Edit prompt:".
Do NOT include any disclaimers, notes, or additional commentary.
Simply output the prompt text that should be sent directly to the image editing model."""

IMAGE_GEN_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You will be provided with a user's chat message and context history for a chatbot integration.
The message has been predetermined to be a request for an AI-generated image. 
Your task is to create an optimal prompt for image generation based on the user's request and conversation context.

Guidelines for creating effective image generation prompts:
1. Be specific and descriptive - include details about subject, setting, lighting, mood, style, and perspective
2. Include artistic style references when appropriate (e.g., "in the style of impressionism", "photorealistic", "digital art")
3. Mention color palettes or specific colors that would enhance the image
4. Include camera details for photographic styles (e.g., "shot with a wide-angle lens", "aerial view", "macro photography")
5. Specify image composition elements like foreground/background, focal points, or arrangement
6. Incorporate relevant details from previous messages in the conversation history
7. Keep the prompt between 50-150 words for optimal results

Format your response as a straightforward generative art prompt WITHOUT any introductory text, explanations, or quotation marks.
Do NOT include phrases like "Here's a prompt:" or "Image prompt:".
Do NOT include any disclaimers, notes, or additional commentary.
Simply output the prompt text that should be sent directly to the image generation model."""
